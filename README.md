## 📌 Project Overview

The client requested a complete conversion of a pre-designed **HTML layout** into a fully functional **WordPress website**, with the ability to customize:

- Text & content  
- Layout & styling  
- Buttons, links, and UI elements  

To achieve this, I developed **custom Elementor widgets**—one for each major section of the original design—allowing full visual and structural flexibility through the Elementor interface.
